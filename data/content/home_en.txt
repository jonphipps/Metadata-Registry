Welcome to The Registry!
============
This is the home page for the Open Metadata Registry (formerly the NSDL Registry).

The Metadata Registry provides services to developers and consumers of controlled vocabularies and is one of the first production deployments of the [RDF-based](http://www.w3.org/RDF/) [Semantic Web Community's](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/) [Simple Knowledge Organization System](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/) (SKOS)

How to begin

[Step-by-step illustrated instructions...](http://wiki.metadataregistry.org/Open_Metadata_Registry_Step-By-Step_Instruction)

Play in the [Metadata Registry Sandbox](http://sandbox.metadataregistry.org)
============
If you just want to experiment and play around a bit, go on over to the [Metadata Registry Sandbox](http://beta.metadataregistry.org). The code is exactly the same, but it's using a non-production database. (Please be careful not to kick any sand out of the box)
NOTE: The [sandbox](http://sandbox.metadataregistry.org) has its own domain now. If you had bookmarked the [beta](http://beta.metadataregistry.org) site thinking that it was the sandbox (and we did say that), it will shortly be a real beta site again complete with broken code, wacky ideas, and disappearing data.
Please change your sandbox bookmarks to point to the [Metadata Registry Sandbox](http://sandbox.metadataregistry.org). Any of the sandcastles that you had built in the [beta](http://beta.metadataregistry.org), back when you thought it was the [sandbox](http://sandbox.metadataregistry.org), are still there.
