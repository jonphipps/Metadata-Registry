Welcome to The Registry!
============
This is the home page for the [National Science Digital Library](http://www.nsdl.org/) Metadata Registry.

The Metadata Registry provides services to developers and consumers of controlled vocabularies and is one of the first production deployments of the [RDF-based](http://www.w3.org/RDF/) [Semantic Web Community's](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/) [Simple Knowledge Organization System](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/) (SKOS)

How to begin

[Step-by-step illustrated instructions...](http://wiki.metadataregistry.org/Step-By-Step_Instruction)

Play in the [Metadata Registry Sandbox](http://sandbox.metadataregistry.org)
============
If you just want to experiment and play around a bit, go on over to the [Metadata Registry Sandbox](http://beta.metadataregistry.org). The code is exactly the same, but it's using a non-production database. (Please be careful not to kick any sand out of the box)
NOTE: The [sandbox](http://sandbox.metadataregistry.org) has its own domain now. If you had bookmarked the [beta](http://beta.metadataregistry.org) site thinking that it was the sandbox (and we did say that), it will shortly be a real beta site again complete with broken code, wacky ideas, and disappearing data.
Please change your sandbox bookmarks to point to the [Metadata Registry Sandbox](http://sandbox.metadataregistry.org). Any of the sandcastles that you had built in the [beta](http://beta.metadataregistry.org), back when you thought it was the [sandbox](http://sandbox.metadataregistry.org), are still there.
