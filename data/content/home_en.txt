Welcome to The Registry!
============
This is the home page for the [National Science Digital Library](http://www.nsdl.org/) Metadata Registry.

The Metadata Registry provides services to developers and consumers of controlled vocabularies and is one of the first production deployments of the [RDF-based](http://www.w3.org/RDF/) [Semantic Web Community's](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/) [Simple Knowledge Organization System](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/) (SKOS)

How to begin
------------
1. Click on “sign in/register” in the top right hand corner and register yourself as a user.
2. You will be presented with a list of current vocabularies, and a button on the bottom of the list that says “create.”  If you click this button, you will be presented with a form to fill out for your vocabulary.
3. Once your vocabulary is registered, you may add concepts by clicking on the concepts tab at the top, and clicking on the “create” button to invoke the concepts form. After the first concept is registered, you can use “save and add” to save the current concept and allow you to register the next in one step.  We suggest that you register all your concepts FIRST, before adding any properties to the concepts (why we suggest this will become more obvious when you begin to create relationships between concepts).
4. Once your concepts are registered, you can go through and add additional properties. When you add “broader,” “narrower,” or “related” properties to a concept, The Registry will automatically maintain these relationships in the related concepts.
5. Each vocabulary has a "get RDF" button that you can use to view your vocabulary in RDF, and each vocabulary and concept URI is "live" and resolves to either RDF or XHTML, depending on the requested content.

The Registry can also provide "namespace" services to help you create and manage a unique namespace for your vocabulary as well as provide a permanent, [resolvable URI](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/BestPractices/VM/http-examples/) for your vocabulary and each of your concepts.

Documentation
============
[Functional requirements and planning documents](http://metadataregistry.org/wiki/index.php/Working_Notes_and_Documentation)
------------
These documents include use cases, information on versioning strategies, and other detailed information on the registry development process.

[The Registry Blog](http://eg2.ischool.washington.edu/registry/registryblog)
------------
The Registry Blog is where all registry developers are welcome to post on advances and issues.

[Code Development](http://metadataregistry.org/trac/registry/)
------------
The Registry software is available, and will continue to be as the software grows and matures. Instructions for obtaining the latest code can be found at the above link. If you encounter a bug, or would like to make a suggestion, please [create a ticket](http://metadataregistry.org/trac/registry/newticket).

The NSDL Registry is available now!
------------
Although [versioning/history](http://metadataregistry.org/wiki/index.php/Versioning?reg_wikidb_session=aefcef8ffd41d72a8189d95d39779ba9), subscription output, help and [notifications](http://metadataregistry.org/wiki/index.php/NSDL_Registry_Functional_Requirements?reg_wikidb_session=aefcef8ffd41d72a8189d95d39779ba9#Notifications), and [data import](http://metadataregistry.org/wiki/index.php/NSDL_Registry_Use_Case_Documentation_%28Vocabularies%29?reg_wikidb_session=aefcef8ffd41d72a8189d95d39779ba9#Use_Case_4a:_Maintainer_Uploads_non-Hosted_Vocabulary_Terms_to_the_Registry) are not yet available, NSDL projects are welcome to use the Registry to make their vocabularies available to others.  As new functionality is introduced, we will notify all registered users and give instructions on how to use the new functions.

The NSDL Registry is [funded](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0532854) by the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/) (NSF) to provide essential services to the National Science Digital Library [Core Infrastructure](http://citi.comm.nsdl.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl) and associated projects.  It was conceived as a part of a distributed registry system supporting improved interoperability for all.

The NSDL Registry is in active development. Because development began with controlled vocabulary registration, this portion is most complete—other sections will be added as ready.   The vocabularies already registered focus primarily on education.
