Welcome to The Registry Sandbox!
============
This is the playground sandbox for the National Science Digital Library [Metadata Registry](http://metadataregistry.org)

The Registry Sandbox uses it's own database and login, so you can make a fine mess (please try not to kick the sand out of the sandbox).

If you want to really register a vocabulary, head on over to the [Production Metadata Registry](http://metadataregistry.org)

How to begin
------------

The best place to get started might be to see what other folks are doing. Click on 'Browse Vocabularies' over there on the right.

When you're ready to play yourself, here are some [Step-by-step illustrated instructions...](http://metadataregistry.org/wiki/index.php/Step-By-Step_Instruction)

If you want to know more about what's going on here, you can see all of the relevant documentation over at the [Production Metadata Registry](http://metadataregistry.org)

Complaint (and kudos) department
------------

If you encounter a bug, or would like to make a suggestion, please [create a ticket](http://metadataregistry.org/trac/registry/newticket).

Or you can always send us an email...
