About askeet
============

Askeet is a **community based Q&A repository**.

Anyone can post a question about any subject, or answer an existing question.
Registration and use are completely free.
If you need an answer, ask your question, register to its RSS feed of answers, and just wait
until your news aggregator pops out with an answer.
Questions and answers can be rated, so that the most interesting questions and the most
useful answers come first. If you have knowledge to share, pay askeet a visit from time to time,
you might even earn some money.


Askeet is also an open-source software developed in PHP.
Download, adaptation and commercial distribution are free, according to the MIT license.
Version history, bug tracking, wiki and browsable source are available in the [askeet trac](http://trac.askeet.com/).
Easy to install and to customize, askeet may be the solution you are looking for if 
you need a FAQ section on your Intranet, or for a mini knowledge base for your community.

Askeet is also the result of a 24-days tutorial called 
the [symfony advent calendar](http://www.symfony-project.com/askeet), and issued on December 2005 to 
illustrate agile development of a web 2.0 application in PHP with 
the [symfony framework](http://www.symfony-project.com/). Reading the tutorial will introduce you to 
symfony and explain all the code behind the askeet application.

Askeet is published by Sensio and the symfony development team.
