# Enhance you forms with `forms.yml`

Your symfony project's forms can be manipulated globally using the `forms.yml`
configuration file. Once this plugin in installed and enabled you can create a
`forms.yml` file that looks something like this:

    # apps/*/config/forms.yml
    forms:
      sfGuardFormSignin:
        username:
          help: Please enter the username you selected during signup.
        _post_validator:
          invalid: The username and password you entered were not recognized.

    widgets:
      sfWidgetFormInput:
        class: text

    validators:
      sfValidatorEmail:
        invalid: '"%value%" is not a valid email address.'

The effect of this configuration file is just as it appears. Custom error
messages will be added to the `sfGuardFormSignin` form, the CSS class "text"
will be added to all instances of `sfWidgetFormInput`, and a custom error
message will be added to all instances of `sfValidatorEmail`.
