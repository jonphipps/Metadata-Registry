= sfSuperCache plugin =

The `sfSuperCachePlugin` writes your page cache somewhere under your root directory to allow your web server to serve them as fast as possible.

It supports caching by domain name.

Please read the limitations at the end.

== Installation ==

  * Install the plugin
  
  {{{
    symfony plugin-install http://plugins.symfony-project.com/sfSuperCachePlugin
  }}}

  * Choose a directory to store the cache under your web root

    {{{
      mkdir web/cache
      chown apache.apache web/cache
    }}}

  * Add `sfSuperCacheFilter` to your filters
  
  {{{
    supercache:
      class: sfSuperCacheFilter
      param:
        cache_dir: cache
  }}}

  * Replace the 2 following lines in `.htaccess`

  {{{
    RewriteRule ^$ index.html [QSA]
    RewriteRule ^([^.]+)$ $1.html [QSA]
  }}}
  
  by

  {{{
    # if the request starts with /cache
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/cache
    # and it's not the user that requested this in his browser
    RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} !/cache/
    # go
    RewriteRule .* - [L]

    # check the page in the "super" cache
    RewriteRule ^$ index.html
    RewriteRule ^(.+)/$ $1/index.html
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ cache/%{HTTP_HOST}/$1
  }}}

  * Clear you cache

  {{{
    symfony cc
  }}}

  * You're done.

== Known limitations ==

 * your page must ends with the right extension: .html, .xml, ... Because Apache will server these pages, it must be able to guess the content type
 * symfony cc won't clear the "super" cache. It is important to clear both cache at the same time.
 * no vary support
