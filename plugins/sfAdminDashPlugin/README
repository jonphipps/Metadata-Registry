# sfAdminDashPlugin

##Overview

I found for all my symfony projects which had backends I had to create a 
menu to access all the various modules.  This plugin automates the 
process by using a configuration file.

##How to use

###Step 1 - install plugin

Install the plugin, clear the cache and activate the sfAdminDash module 
in the application's *settings.yml*.

    enabled_modules:        [default, sfAdminDash]

###Step 2 - setup theme

Publish the plugin's assets:

    plugin:publish-assets

If the modules are admin generator modules, deactivate the default admin 
generators theme in each module's *generator.yml* by creating a css 
property.  You can either point the css property to a real stylesheet or 
just use a placeholder.

    generator:
      class: sfPropelGenerator
      param:
        model_class:           Article
        theme:                 admin
        non_verbose_templates: true
        with_show:             false
        singular:              ~
        plural:                ~
        route_prefix:          article
        with_propel_route:     1
        css:                   nothing

        config:
          actions: ~
          fields:  ~
          list:    ~
          filter:  ~
          form:    ~
          edit:    ~
          new:     ~

In the future I would like to create an actual theme by overriding the 
default files but I found an issue when trying to do this (see [my 
ticket](http://trac.symfony-project.org/ticket/5697))

Add the plugin's header and footer partials to your applications global 
layout:

    <body>
      <?php include_partial('sfAdminDash/header') ?>
      <?php echo $sf_content ?>
      <?php include_partial('sfAdminDash/footer') ?>
    </body>

  At this point your modules should be styled with the joomla-like 
theme.  There should be a warning saying *Plugin not configured. Please 
see documentation.*  We will fix that soon.

###Step 3 (optional) - setup the dashboard

Set your applications *homepage* in your applications *routing.yml* to 
look like:

    homepage:
      url:   /
      param: { module: sfAdminDash, action: dashboard }

Again you see that warning, we will address that next.

###Step 4 - configure global plugin configuration

The plugin's *app.yml* file looks like the following:

    all:
      sf_admin_dash:
        web_dir:              /sfAdminDashPlugin
        image_dir:            /sfAdminDashPlugin/images/icons/
        default_image:        config.png
        resize_mode:          thumbnail
        logout:               yes
        site:                 My Site
        include_jquery:       yes

* web_dir - where the plugin's default css/javascript/images are kept
* image_dir - where your images for the dash/menu items are kept - 
images should be 48x48
* default_image - the default item image if none is specified - this 
must be in the *image_dir* folder
* resize_mode - how the image will be resized for the menu items
    * thumbnail - looks in a directory inside *image_dir* called small 
for the same image name - these should be 16x16
    * html - resizes the image within the html *img* tag
* logout is whether the logout link should be shown
* site - what you would like the site name to be (shows up in the *path 
bar* as a link)
* include_jquery - the plugin's javascript needs jquery - choose no if 
your application already includes it

Override these settings as you see fit.

###Step 5 - configure the dashboard/menu items

Items are controlled by your application's *app.yml* file.  The best way 
to show how to use this is with an example:

  I have created backend application and 2 admin modules: Comment and 
Article.

  To create dash/menu items for these modules I use this format:

    all:
      sf_admin_dash:
        items:
          Articles:
            url:    article
          Comments:
            url:    comment

This creates 2 items on the dashboard and a *Menu* dropdown.  The url 
property should be an internal URI.  You can also set credentials and an 
image.  The *image* property is just the image name - its location is 
specified in the global settings.

  The credential property can be used to hide options from users who do 
not have specific credentials.  This gives the ability for different 
users to see different options.  The format for this is the same as when 
setting credentials in *security.yml*.
  
  **NOTE:  This just prevents the user from seeing the item.  You still 
need to setup the same credentials in *security.yml* to prevent the user 
from accessing the module.**

Here is an sample configuration:

    all:
      sf_admin_dash:
        items:
          Articles:
            url:          article
            image:        book.png
            credentials:  [[admin, publisher]]
          Comments:
            url:          comment
            image:        textcloud.png
            credentials:  [admin]

The above example shows the *Articles* item only to users with the 
**admin** or **publisher** credential and the *Comments* item only to 
users with the **admin** credential.  The images are self explanatory.  
Packaged with this plugin is a small library of images that can be used.

You can group items into categories as well by embedding the items into 
a *category name* property under *categories* property:

    all:
      sf_admin_dash:
        categories:
          Blog:
            items:
              Articles:
                url:          article
                image:        book.png
                credentials:  [[admin, publisher]]
              Comments:
                url:          comment
                image:        textcloud.png
                credentials:  [admin]
          Category2:
            items:
              ...

Category names are not only seperated on the dashboard but they have 
their own dropdown menu.

  You can set credentials to entire categories like so:

    all:
      sf_admin_dash:
        categories:
          Blog:
            credentials:      [admin]
            items:
              Articles:
                url:          article
                image:        book.png
              Comments:
                url:          comment
                image:        textcloud.png

This hides the entire category from the user if they don't have the 
**admin** credential.

###Step 6 (optional) - setting up login screen

Packaged with this plugin is a partial called *login*.  Currently, it 
works with sfGuardPlugin.  To prevent the path and menu bar from showing 
decorate the login with another layout that calls the *header_top* 
partial rather than *header*.

###todo
* use an actual admin generator theme
* make a more dynamic login screen (configurable in the global config)
* clean up css
