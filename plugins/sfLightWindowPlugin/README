=== Changes from original !LightWindow v2.0 ===
The `sfLightWindowPlugin` uses a slightly altered lightwindow.js source. The only changes made were to the path of the image files, and the option of using an improved inline form handler, found in the last two methods _lwUpdateWithResponse and _lwSingleFormCall.

=== Requirements ===
!LightWindow v2.0 requires at least prototype 1.5.1.1 and scriptaculous > v1.7.1. These are included with the plugin, but you can customize the location of these files in sfLightWindowPlugin/config/config.php.

== Usage == 
lw_link(), lw_image(), lw_media() and more...

The plugin is very easy to use, and supports all the page and media types of !LightWindow. After installing the plugin, just include the helper in your template file and you are off to the races.

{{{
<?php use_helper('LightWindow') ?>
<?php echo lw_link('My LightWindow', 'module/action') ?>
<?php echo lw_media('My Media File', '/gallery/my_movie.mov', 'width=19 height=240') ?>
<?php echo lw_image(image_tag('pic_thumb.jpg'), '/gallery/pic.jpg') ?>
<?php echo lw_button('click to open!', '/images/yourimage.png', array(
  'title'   => "Great Pic",
  'author'  => "Stereo",
  'caption' => "Your caption",
  'left'    => 300,
)) ?>
}}}


You can also add any of the the following options in the third parameter:
{{{
title         // title of window
author        // author of window
caption       // the caption for the window
width         // Width of window
height        // Height of window
show_images   // Number of images to show at once in a gallery
top           // Set as an Integer to be spaced from the Top
left          // Set as an Integer to be spaced from the Left
type          // Specify the type of content served: page, external, image, media, inline
loading_animation // Set to false to opt to not fade out the Loading Cover
iframe_embed  // To embed media into a media into an iframe rather than just into a div
form          // The name of the form
}}}

To create a gallery, you use the lw_gallery() function with an array of image attributes.
{{{
<?php 
  $media = array();

  $media[] = array(
    'link'    => '<strong>Image Gallery</strong> - Everyone needs a killer gallery!',
    'src'     => '/sfLightWindowPlugin/gallery/0.jpg',
    'options' => array(
      'class' => 'page-options',
      'title' => 'High 5 Dood!',
      'caption'=> 'Snow people know how to have fun...',
    ),
  );

  $media[] = array(
    'link'  => 'Header #3',
    'src'   => '/sfLightWindowPlugin/gallery/header3.swf?scale=noscale&amp;tag1=Sooth Your Mind &amp; Body&amp;tag2=Justice Through Integrity&amp;tag3=Helping Injured Victims&amp;tag4=Experience You Can Trust',
    'options' => array(
      'width' => '769',
      'height'=> '209',
      'title' => "Oh My! Flash and Images Mixed!",
      'author'=> false,
      'caption'=> false,
    ),
  );
    
  $gallery_options = array(
    'hide' => true,
    'title' => 'default title',
    'caption' => 'default caption',
    'author' => 'Unknown',
  );

  echo lw_gallery($media, 'Random[Sample Images]', $gallery_options);
?>
}}}
