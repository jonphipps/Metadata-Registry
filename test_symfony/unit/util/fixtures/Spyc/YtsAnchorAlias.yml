test: Simple Alias Example 
brief: > 
    If you need to refer to the same item of data twice, 
    you can give that item an alias.  The alias is a plain 
    string, starting with an ampersand.  The item may then 
    be referred to by the alias throughout your document 
    by using an asterisk before the name of the alias. 
    This is called an anchor. 
yaml: | 
    - &showell Steve 
    - Clark 
    - Brian 
    - Oren 
    - *showell 
python: | 
    [ 
        [ 'Steve', 'Clark', 'Brian', 'Oren', 'Steve'] 
    ] 
ruby-setup: | 
    showell = 'Steve' 
ruby: | 
    [ showell, 'Clark', 'Brian', 'Oren', showell ]

test: Alias of a Mapping 
brief: > 
    An alias can be used on any item of data, including 
    sequences, mappings, and other complex data types. 
yaml: | 
    - &hello 
        Meat: pork 
        Starch: potato 
    - banana 
    - *hello 
python: | 
    [ 
        [  
            {'Meat': 'pork', 'Starch': 'potato'},  
            'banana', 
            {'Meat': 'pork', 'Starch': 'potato'},  
        ] 
    ] 
ruby-setup: | 
    hello = { 'Meat' => 'pork', 'Starch' => 'potato' } 
ruby: | 
    [  
      hello,  
      'banana', 
      hello 
    ]
