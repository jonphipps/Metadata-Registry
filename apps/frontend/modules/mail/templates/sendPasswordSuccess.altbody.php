Dear Registry user,
 
A request for <?php echo $mail->getSubject() ?> was sent to this address.
 
For safety reasons, the Registry website does not store unencrypted passwords.
When you forget your password, the Registry assigns you a new one..
 
You can now connect to your Registry profile with:
 
login name: <?php echo $nickname ?>
  password: <?php echo $password ?>
 
To get connected, go to the login page (http://metadataregistry.org/login.html).
 
We hope to see you soon on The Registry!
