View Configuration
==================

Overview
--------

The View is made of:

* one part resulting of the action execution (the template)
* all the rest (headers, metas, file inclusions, slots and layout)

Symfony offers two convenient ways to modify the components of the View that are not part of the template.

The two ways to modify the view
-------------------------------

Apart from the template itself, which integrates the variables calculated in the action into the view, every action needs control over other parts of the view:

* **meta declarations**: keywords, description or cache duration 
* **page title**: not only does it help users with several browser windows open to find yours, but it is also very important for search sites indexing
* **file inclusions**: javascript and stylesheet files
* **slots inclusions**: navigation bar, header, footer, breadcrumb, etc.
* **layout**: some actions require a custom layout (popups, ads, ajax, etc.)

Ideally, all these parameters should be defined in a configuration file, so that the action can deal only with application logic and leave presentation to the view. However, in many cases, these parameters have dynamic values (for instance, page titles often show the title of articles) and cannot be kept in static configuration files. That's why symfony provides two ways to modify them:

* the `view.yml` file, in which these parameters can be set at the application, module and action levels
* the **view helpers**, which are methods accessible from within the action.

According to the nature of the values that you need to give to these parameters, you will prefer one method or another. It is recommended that you keep as much configuration in the `view.yml` files as possible, since it separates clearly logic from presentation.

>**Note**: the `view.yml` solution offers the advantage of inheritance and specialization. If you have to use the helpers in the action but you don't want to repeat them for every action, use the `preExecute()` and `postExecute()` methods of the module class to avoid repeating helpers for every action of a module.
 
View.yml structure
------------------

The scope of a `view.yml` varies according to the place where it is stored:

* in `myproject/apps/myapp/config/`, the definitions will apply to all modules and all actions of the application
* in `myproject/apps/myapp/modules/mymodule/config/`, the definitions will apply only to one module and override the application-level definitions

In addition, for the module-level files, you have the ability to specify custom definitions for a specific view (pair action/result of the action):

    view1:
      ...    
    view2:
      ...
    all:
      ...

The next sections will detail how the parameter definitions in this file can affect the view:

* http-metas: _(associative array)_
 * key: value _(string)_
* metas: _(associative array)_
 * key: value _(string)_
* title: page_name _(string)_
* stylesheets: [stylesheet1, stylesheet2, ...] _(array)_
* javascripts: [javascript1, javascript2, ...] _(array)_
* layout: layout_name _(string)_
* slots: _(associative array)_
 * slot_name: [module, action] _(array)_

Default configuration
---------------------

The default global template, created when you initialize an application, is called `layout.php`. It is located in `myproject/apps/myapp/templates/` and looks like this:

    [php]
    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xhtml1-200000126/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
    <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en">
    <head>
    
    <?php echo include_http_metas() ?>
    <?php echo include_metas() ?>
    
    <?php echo include_title() ?>
    
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico">
    
    </head>
    <body>
    
    <?php echo $content ?>
    
    </body>
    </html>

The default settings of the view, set in the application view configuration file `myproject/apps/myapp/config/view.yml`, are:

    all:
      http_metas:
        content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
      
      metas:
        title:        symfony project
        robots:       index, follow
        description:  symfony project
        keywords:     symfony, project
        
      stylesheets:    [main]
      
      javascripts:    [ ]

      has_layout:     on
      layout:         layout

      components:     {}

When applied to the layout, these settings produce the following `<head>` section:

    [php]
    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xhtml1-200000126/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
    <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en">
    <head>
    
    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
    <meta name="title" content="symfony project" />
    <meta name="robots" content="index, follow" />
    <meta name="description" content="symfony project" />
    <meta name="keywords" content="symfony, project" />
    
    <title>symfony project</title>
    
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="/css/main.css" />
    
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico">
    
    </head>
    <body>
    
    <?php echo $content ?>
    
    </body>
    </html>

Besides the obvious use of the parameter definitions in the `view.yml`, this example shows that the `<head>` section of a page can be modified even if the code for this section is normally in a file shared by all modules.

View configuration could stop at that point if you wish. There is no absolute necessity to define view parameters for each module, since the default behaviors of actions will manage for you the choice of the template to be used. However, as soon as your application uses more than one layout, custom javascripts or stylesheets, or if the interface shows common components on every page, writing `view.yml` files for your modules will save you time and ease your work.

>**Note**: If you want to create custom layouts, you can use the `include_` functions to get the values of the head parameters and take advantage of the configuration files.

Meta configuration
------------------

The information written in the `meta` tags is not displayed but is useful for robots and search engines. It also controls the cache settings of every page.

To set these parameters for a modules, use these keys in a `view.yml` file:

    http_metas:
      $key: $value
    
    metas:
      $key: $value

To modify these settings from within an action, use these methods:

    [php]
    $this->getResponse()->addHttpMeta($key, $value)
    $this->getResponse()->addMeta($key, $value)

Adding an existing key will replace its current content.

Let's image that you display an article about finance in France that will not change. You can write in the view configuration file:

    http_metas:
      cache-control:public
    
    metas:
      description:  Finance in France
      keywords:     finance, France

Or, alternatively, call in the action:

    [php]
    $this->getResponse()->addHttpMeta('cache-control', 'public');
    $this->getResponse()->addMeta('description','Finance in France');
    $this->getResponse()->addMeta('keywords', 'finance, France');

When the template is included in the layout, the `include_` helpers of the `<head>` part will give:

    [php]
    <meta http-equiv="cache-control" content="public">
    <meta name="description" content="Finance in France" />
    <meta name="keywords" content="finance, France" />   

As a bonus, the HTTP header of the HTML file will also contain the `http-metas` setting. This means this if you need to modify the HTTP headers, the `http-metas` section of the `view.yml` is the solution, even if you don't have any `<?php echo include_http_metas() ?>` in the layout -- or if you have no layout. For instance, if you need to send a page as plain text, type:

    http_metas:
      content-type: text/plain
    
    has_layout: false    

Title configuration
-------------------

Page title is a key part to search engine indexing; it is also very useful with modern browsers that provide tabbed-browsing.

To have a custom title for every page, take advantage of the  `<?php echo include_title() ?>` call in the `<head>` part of the layout.

If your title only depends on the view, you should specify `title` in the `view.yml`:

    indexSuccess:
      title: 'Description'
      
    indexError:
      title: 'Problem while displaying the description'
    
    listSuccess:
      title:  'Result list'

On the other hand, if an action can give pages with various titles, you should use the  `setTitle($title)` function:

    [php]
    $this->setTitle($title);

>**Note**: the `<meta name="title"...` is not modified by the `setTitle` function. Modify the `head.yml` or use the `addMeta` function if you want to change it.

File inclusion configuration
----------------------------

### Basic syntax

To include a specific stylesheet or a specific javascript file in the view configuration file, use:

    stylesheets: [$css]
    javascripts: [$js]

To do it from an action, use:

    [php]
    $this->getResponse()->addStylesheet($css);
    $this->getResponse()->addJavascript($js);

In each case, the argument is a file name. If it has a logical extension (`.css` for a stylesheet and `.js` for a javascript), you can omit it. If it has a logical location (`/css/` for a stylesheet and `/js/` for a javascript), you can also omit it.

For instance, in an action called `subscribe` using a calendar widget, the view could be configured with:

    subscribeSuccess:
      stylesheets: [calendar/skins/aqua/theme]
      javascripts: [calendar/calendar_stripped, calendar/calendar-en, calendar/calendar-setup_stripped]

Alternatively, you could require the files from the action with:

    [php]
    $this->getResponse()->addStylesheet('calendar/skins/aqua/theme');
    $this->getResponse()->addJavascript('calendar/calendar_stripped');
    $this->getResponse()->addJavascript('calendar/calendar-en');
    $this->getResponse()->addJavascript('calendar/calendar-setup_stripped');

The `<head>` of the resulting view would then show:

    [php]
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="/js/calendar/skins/aqua/theme.css" />
    <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="/js/calendar/calendar_stripped.js"></script>
    
    <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="/js/calendar/lang/calendar-en.js"></script>
    <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="/js/calendar/calendar-setup_stripped.js"></script>

>**Note**: In previous versions of symfony, this type of inclusion was only possible if you included calls to the `include_stylesheets()` and `include_javascripts()` helpers in the `<head>` section of the layout. This is not necessary anymore, and the use of these helpers is deprecated.

### Addition, removal, ordering

When you mention a stylesheet or a JavaScript in a `view.yml`, it appears in the response `<head>` *in addition to the ones already defined* and after them. The addition of these files follows the usual cascade definition, and the order of inclusion is from the most general to the most particular.

For instance, if your application `view.yml` stipulates:

    default:
      stylesheets: [main]
      
And if you have, in your module `config/view.yml`:

    indexSuccess:
      stylesheets: [special]
    
    all:
      stylesheets: [additional]

Then the `<head>` of the resulting `indexSuccess` view will show:

    [php]
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="/css/main.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="/css/additional.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="/css/special.css" />
    
The same applies for the JavaScript inclusions. This allows you to override global settings at the module and view level.

To give you more control over this cascade, you can remove an already included stylesheet or JavaScript by prefixing its name with a minus sign ('-') in the `view.yml`

    # adds a new stylesheet and removes the default one (as defined in the global view.yml)
    indexSuccess:
      stylesheets: [special, -main]

You can be more accurate from within an action and define an additional parameter to force the position where to include the file (`first` or `last` position):

    [php]
    $this->getResponse()->addStylesheet('special', 'first');

### Media specific stylesheet

To specify a media for a stylesheet inclusion, you can change the default stylesheet tag options:

    stylesheets: [main, main_for_print: { media: print }]

or

    [php]
    $this->getResponse()->addStylesheet('main_for_print', array('media' => 'print'));

Layout configuration
--------------------

According to the graphical charter of your website, you may have several layouts. Classical websites have at least two: the default layout, and the popup layout.

You already saw that the default layout is `myproject/apps/myapp/templates/layout.php`.  You don't need to set it in the application-level view configuration. Additional layouts have to be added in the same directory.

If you need to use a different layout for a view, use:

    layout: $layoutname

Or in the action:

    [php]
    $this->setLayout($layoutname);

For instance, if all the actions of the `rules` module use the `content.php` layout, except the `securitypolicy` action for which you need the `popup.php` layout, you can write:

    securitypolicySuccess:
      layout: popup
      
    all:
      layout: content

The same is possible in the `Actions.class.php` file:

    [php]
    class rulesActions extends sfActions
    {
      public function preExecute()
      {
        $this->setLayout('content');
      }
      
      public function executeSecuritypolicy()
      {
        $this->setLayout('popup');
        ...
      }
    }

Some views don't need any layout at all (for instance plain text pages). In that case, use:

    has_layout: false

Or, in the action:

    [php]
    $this->hasLayout(false);

Component slots configuration
-----------------------------

Common interface components with dynamic content (breadcrumbs, navigation bars, etc.) that require the execution of a component (the "light" version of an action) are published in *component slots* in symfony. The definition in the `view.yml` looks like:

    components:
      $componentname: [$module, $action]
    
Imagine that you have a layout with a zone for contextual advices:

    [php]
    ...
    <div id="adviceBlock">
      <?php echo include_component_slot('advices') ?>
    </div>
    ...

You also have a module `advice` with contextual components `forIndex` and `forList`. Now, if you want to associate a contextual component with the views of a module `article` with actions `index` and `list`, you could write the following `myproject/apps/myapp/modules/article/config/view.yml`:

    indexSuccess:
      components:
        advices: [advice, forIndex]

    listSuccess:
      components:
        advices: [advice, forList]

How about template configuration?
---------------------------------

Though you could expect to see a way to set a custom template with one of the two ways described here, there is none.

The reason is that when you need to set a custom template for an action, you should do either a `redirect` or a `forward` of this action to another one. The context will be much cleaner and the logic of your application will be preserved.
