Where does symfony look for files ?
===================================

Overview
--------

From time to time, you may wonder where is a particular ressource that is used by your project. This chapter locates the most useful files.

There are too many files!
------------------------

If you read all the introduction to the symfony framework, you might fear that your project end up in hundreds of files. Well, this is partly false, and the true part is for your own benefit. But let's try to see why.

In order to display one single "hello world" page, you need:

* two files (an `actions.class.php` defining an emply `index` action and an `actionSuccess.php` template)
* three directories (one for the module, and two `actions` and `templates` directories)

This is actually quite a lot. This illustrates one good point : using symfony for very simple, non-dynamic applications may be a waste of time.

But now, imagine an e-commerce application that sells leather belts of all sizes and all materials, with a built-in stock management and back-office to add and modify products and to deliver commands. 

Apart from the fact that such an application would only require a few hours to build with symfony, the structuration into various files allows several people to work on it at the same time (webdesigners work on templates, webdeveloppers work on actions, administrators work on configuration files, and the client can update the data live through the back-office) with a mnimum risk of conflict. It organizes the content into a logical structure, so that you don't need to browse too long a time to find the ressource you're looking for. And, if you really don't know where to find something, the generated documentation or this very chapter will solve your problem.

So, you need to open a configuration file to add a stylesheet to a module ? That's true, but you have then the visibility over all additionnal stylesheets in one type of file that can be located within seconds in each module.

Were does symfony look for...
-----------------------------

* the default layout

        [myproject]/apps/[myapp]/templates/layout.php

* the default 404 page

        symfony/modules/default/templates/error404Success.php
        // can be overriden for a given application at
        [myproject]/apps/[myapp]/modules/default/templates/error404Success.php

* the database access configuration

        [myproject]/apps/[myapp]/config/orm.yml

* the interface translation files of an internationalized application

        [myproject]/apps/[myapp]/i18n/

* the cached web pages

        [myproject]/cache/[myapp]/[environment]

* the title of a web page

        // default title
        [myproject]/apps/[myapp]/config/view.yml
        // title action by action
        [myproject]/apps/[myapp]/modules/[mymodule]/config/view.yml

* the complete settings file
