Unfortunately on some browsers (notably Firefox running in chrome mode), sending modified keys leads to
 commands executing which ruined the test run.  In this case, a dialog box appeared to allow the user to
 save the current page.  This is not what we want in an automated test run, so I am disabling this part of the test.
