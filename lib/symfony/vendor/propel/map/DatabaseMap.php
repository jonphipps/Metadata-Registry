/**
 * DatabaseMap is used to model a database.
 *
 * GENERAL NOTE
 * ------------
 * The propel.map classes are abstract building-block classes for modeling
 * the database at runtime.  These classes are similar (a lite version) to the
 * propel.engine.database.model classes, which are build-time modeling classes.
 * These classes in themselves do not do any database metadata lookups, but instead 
 * are used by the MapBuilder classes that were generated for your datamodel. The 
 * MapBuilder that was created for your datamodel build a representation of your
 * database by creating instances of the DatabaseMap, TableMap, ColumnMap, etc. 
 * classes. See propel/templates/om/php5/MapBuilder.tpl and the classes generated
 * by that template for your datamodel to further understand how these are put 
 * together.
