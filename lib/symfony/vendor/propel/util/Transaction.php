/**
 * Utility class to make it easier to begin, commit, and rollback transactions.
 * 
 * This can be used to handle cases where transaction support is optional.
 * The second parameter of beginOptionalTransaction() will determine with a transaction 
 * is used or not. If a transaction is not used, the commit and rollback methods
 * do not have any effect. Instead it simply makes the logic easier to follow
 * by cutting down on the if statements based solely on whether a transaction
 * is needed or not.
