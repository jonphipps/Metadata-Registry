  ChangeLog for 1.2.1 at http://propel.phpdb.org/trac/query?status=closed&milestone=1.2.1&resolution=fixed&order=priority
 
 Aug 31, 2006 - 1.2.0

  Breaking Changes:
  *** New API for generic accessors and settors (see API docs).  The methods are 
  the same but the default indexing has changed.
  *** New API for validators (see Wiki / docs).

  Major Changes (for complete list see issue tracker at http://propel.phpdb.org):
  - Propel now compatible w/ PHP >= 5.0.5 & 5.1.x
  - New MySQLi driver for Propel (use 'mysqli' instead of 'mysql')
  - Added propel-gen script to standard-installed versions of Propel also
  - New XSD schema for validating the XML datamodel descriptions (schema.xml)
  - Support for specifying vendor-specific info in the schema.xml
  - Better support for sequences in reverse engineering PostgreSQL databases
  - #146 Added 'size' attribute to <index-column> and <unique-column>
  - New extensible OO builder classes for generating PHP5 classes and SQL DDL
  - Identifier escaping in generated SQL (note: for Postgres this means columns
    are case-sensitive)
  - Numerous improvements to validation framework, including new, cleaner API
  - Added doCountJoin*() methods to the generated Peer classes
  - Obj->save() calls now return the number of affected rows (if supported by db)
  - See http://propel.phpdb.org/trac/report/9 for complete list of closed tickets 
  	by milestone.
  
 April 7, 2005 - 1.1.0

  Big Changes:
  *** Changed retrieveByPK() to return NULL instead of throw Exception if no row
      was matched. (Dave Lawson)
  *** New PHP runtime conf format has changed (must regenerate conf file).
  *** Dropped support for deprecated ini-format runtime properties file. (Hans)
  *** Cleanup of build properties files, removal of deprecated properties. (Hans)

  New Features:
  - Schema attributes are no longer case-sensitive.
  - New <vendor> tag allows specifying vendor-specific attributes. (Pavel)
  - MySQL identifiers escaping added to SQL generation templates. (Pavel)
  - MySQL unique indexes SQL generation added. (Pavel)
  - Added support for interface="" attribute of <table> tag; defaults to Persistent. (Hans)
  - Added doSelectJoinAll() to generated peer classes. (Hans)
  - Added doDeleteAll() method to remove all rows from specified table. (Hans)
  - Added support for returning affected rows from update methods in peer classes. (Hans)
  - Added PHPUnit2-based unit testing framework to replace old bookstore-test.php
  - Added schema validation / error throwing to schema parser. (Pavel)
  - Logging is now optional (no log section means no logger used).  (David Zülke)
  - Added TIMESTAMP_BU, DATE_BU types for "before-unix" (pre 1970) dates. (Hans)

  Bug Fixes:
  - Fixed E_STRICT error in generated Peer doCount() method (Hans)
  - Fixed bug when using doSelectJoin*() methods with tables that have lazyload columns. (Hans)
  - Fixed logic bugs in doSelectJoinExcept*() method generation. (Hans)
  - Fixed support for temporal (date/time) default values. (Hans)
  - Fixed bug where setting only default values in object would result in no save. (Hans)
  - Fixes to PropelSQLExecTask to handle non-typical queries (Dominik, Hans).
  - Fixed bug in enumerated inheritance when using string coltype (Kaspars)
  - Fixes to charset / encoding in schema creation. (Joe Cai, Pavel)
  - Fixed nested external schema bug. (Pavel)
  - Fixed unexpected results bug in NodePeer::buildFamilyCriteria(). (Dave Lawson)
  - Fixed clearSelectColumns() to also clear $asColumns. (Fabien Potencier)

  Oct. 24, 2004 - 1.0.0

    Big Changes:
  - Removed Transaction class, refactoring functionality into Creole
    Connection classes (Dave Lawson)
  - New NodePeer for handling hierarchies (Dave Lawson)
  - Propel has a new default directory layout for projects.  All project
      files are now located in one directory.

    projects/
         |- bookstore/
         |   |- build/
         |   |- schema.xml
         |   |- runtime.properties  <-- deprecated
         |   |- runtime-conf.xml    <-- new standard

    - Added new default XML format for setting Propel's runtime properties.
      (see dir layout above).

    - Added new build.xml to wrap build-propel.xml.  New file is preferred
      way to build projects, as it allows for inclusion of project-specific
      build.properties files. Propel is finally fully multi-project friendly.

  - Support for specifying "lazy-load" columns in schema XML.  Lazy load
    columns will only be populated on demand.  This means that by default
    object hyradtion will not include these columns (so smaller, faster
    objects), but also that an additional query is executed when data is
    needed.  (This is particularly useful for BLOB/CLOB columns.)

    Minor Changes:
    [Generated Classes]
    - Peer::populateObject() method deprecated (will remove in Propel 1.1) in
    favor of Object->hydrate()
    - Removed Peer::buildCriteria() method in favor of Object->buildCriteria()
    and Object->buildPkeyCriteria()
    - Peer doSelect*() family of methods now [consistently] only takes
    Criteria objects for parameter.
    - No more support in generated Peer classes for using Criteria with
    different DB name.
    - Date/time setter methods now perform a strtotime() conversion on passed
    data and throw a PropelException is such a conversion cannot be performed.
  - New copy() method replaces non-working __clone() impl.  __clone() unused due
    to desire to have a way to copy objects w/o necessarying copying rows.

    [Default Properties]
    - The schema include pattern changed to *schema.xml (instead of
    *-schema.xml), for added flexibility in layout.

  [SQL Generator]
  - Updated model classes to recognize boolean values in case-insensitive
    manner (allow "TRUE" & "true").
  - Updated model classes to recognize Propel types in case-insensitive
    manner (allow "integer" & "INTEGER").

  June 8, 2003 - 1.0.0-beta1

    Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed 'creole' target to include database name in generated schema XML
    - Fixed Propel to work correctly with tables that have pkey, but no
    autoIncrement cols
    - Fixed Criteria toString() method to work [for SELECT clauses only]
    - TIMESTAMP defaults to DATETIME for MySQL
    - Added support for COMMENT keyword (for descriptions from schema) in
    MySQL table definitions
    - Fixed Table->containsColumn() method in propel-generator
    - Fixed insert-sql to work with multi-line & complex SQL statements (Dominik del Bondio)

  May 2, 2004 - 1.0.0-alpha2

  Bug Fixes:
  - LONGVARCHAR no longer considered LOB column (HL)
  - Added INDEX for MySQL/InnoDB foreign keys
  - Removed old references to BOOLEANINT/BOOLEANCHAR from platform classes (HL)
  - Allow missing autoIncrement column w/o requiring idMethod="none" (HL)
  - Fixed parse errors in generated classes w/ multi-column primary key (HL)

  New Features:
  - Added column validator framework and validator suite (MA)
  - Added doCount() method to generated peers (MA)
