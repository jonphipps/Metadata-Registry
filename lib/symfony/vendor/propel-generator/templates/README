This directory contains PHP templates which are used to build SQL files and object 
model (OM) classes.  The PHP templates are called from the 
propel.phing.PropelDataModelTask class.  The templates are managed by the Capsule 
engine, which simply provides a mechanism for placing values in the template context 
and buffering output, etc.
