/**
 * CodeBase driver-specific behavior.
 *
 * This adapter is for Sequiter's CodeBaseSQL product. It is a dBase ODBC
 * driver. The driver only supports forward-only cursor scrolling so this
 * adapter causes the ODBCCachedResultSet to be used.
 *
 * A couple other quirks exist: 
 * 
 * 1) Cannot get blobs to work correctly. If I try writing one to a 
 *    LONGVARBINARY typed field, only the first few bytes are written.
 *    This will cause the ResultSetTest::testGetBlob() test case to fail
 *    when running tests for the driver.
 *
 * 2) For some reason the character count is off for the 
 *    ResultSetTest::testSetClob() test case _only_ when running from the 
 *    command line. If I run the same test through a web server it works fine.
 *    Looks like it has something to do with line endings in Windows. The 
 *    difference in file sizes is 9803 vs 10090.
 *
 * 3) Setting a clob field to null writes a space to the field in the table. 
 *    This causes the PreparedStatementTest::testSetNull() test case to fail 
 *    when running tests for the driver.
