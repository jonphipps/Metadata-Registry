/**
 * This is the interface for classes the wrap db results.
 * 
 * The get*() methods in this interface will format values before returning them. Note
 * that if they will return null if the database returned NULL.  If the requested column does
 * not exist than an exception (SQLException) will be thrown.
 * 
 * <code>
 * $rs = $conn->executeQuery("SELECT MAX(stamp) FROM event", ResultSet::FETCHMODE_NUM);
 * $rs->next();
 * 
 * $max_stamp = $rs->getTimestamp(1, "d/m/Y H:i:s");
 * // $max_stamp will be date string or null if no MAX(stamp) was found
 * 
 * $max_stamp = $rs->getTimestamp("max(stamp)", "d/m/Y H:i:s");
 * // will THROW EXCEPTION, because the resultset was fetched using numeric indexing
 * // SQLException: Invalid resultset column: max(stamp)
 * </code>
 * 
 * This class implements SPL IteratorAggregate, so you may iterate over the database results
 * using foreach():
 * <code>
 * foreach($rs as $row) {
 *   print_r($row); // row is assoc array returned by getRow()
 * }
