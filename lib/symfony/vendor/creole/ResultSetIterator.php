/**
 * Basic ResultSet Iterator.
 * 
 * This can be returned by your class's getIterator() method, but of course
 * you can also implement your own (e.g. to get better performance, by using direct
 * driver calls and avoiding other side-effects inherent in ResultSet scrolling
 * functions -- e.g. beforeFirst() / afterLast(), etc.).
 *
 * Important: ResultSet iteration does rewind the resultset if it is not at the
 * start.  Not all drivers support reverse scrolling, so this may result in an
 * exception in some cases (Oracle).
 * 
 * Developer note:
 * The implementation of this class is a little weird because it fetches the
 * array _early_ in order to answer valid() w/o needing to know total num
 * of fields.  Remember the way iterators work:
 * <code>
 * $it = $obj->getIterator();
 * for($it->rewind(); $it->valid(); $it->next()) {
 *  $key = $it->current();
 *  $val = $it->key();
 *  echo "$key = $val\n";
 * }
 * unset($it);
 * </code>
