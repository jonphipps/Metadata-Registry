  TODO
  ----

  For a list of current tasks see:
  <http://phing.tigris.org>


  GENERAL
  -------

  - Investigate whether PHP5 stream filters would work as a replacement
  for current ChainedFilter	system in Phing.  If so, we could probably
  expect great speed increase by implementing native stream filtering.
  
  - Customize & standardize the Phing IO layer.  We don't want to simply
  emulate the Java IO layer (e.g. we don't want the default reading method
  to be char-by-char, especially where filters are concerned), but we need
  something intuitive and standard.  Currently it's somewhat of a mess, which
  tacked on functions like readChar() and then only buffered Reader classes
  implement readLine() -- because of Java assumption that read() returns one
  char.
  
  - Experiment with a PHP-GTK frontend.  The necessary hooks should now be 
  in place to swap out the command line interface with a graphical front-end.


  PHPUNIT2 TASKS
  --------------

  - Ability to configure the PHPUnit2_Util_Filter class using its 
  addFileToFilter() and removeFileFromFilter() methods from within 
  a build.xml file.

  - Install XSL stylesheets in default path


  DOCUMENTATION
  -------------

  - Add PHPUnit tests for any of the many un-unit-tested tasks or types.
  - Add the less-known tasks to the user guide:  ExitTask, ReflexiveTask
