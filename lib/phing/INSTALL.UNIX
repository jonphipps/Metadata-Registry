  Welcome to Phing!
  -----------------

  In this file you find a quick installation guide for PHING. For a more
  details regarding the setup procedure see the usersguide pdf or html
  in docs/.


  Prerequisites
  -------------

  At this point we assume you have a running Linux or other UNIX dialect with
  a properly installed release of PHP5.0.1+. You need the CLI version of PHP,
  since there is no WEB-Application for Phing provided, and the ISAPI module
  will not work on command line. The PHP binary must have compiled-in XML
  support and optionally XSLT support if you want to use XSLT
  transformation

  We also assume you have shell-access to your system and your are logged in
  with the bash2 shell. If you're using tcsh, csh or other shells please refer
  to your shells' manpage for the syntax on how to set environment variables.

  PEAR Installation
  -----------------

  NOTE: As of Phing 2.0.0b1, Phing is available as a PEAR package.  This 
  makes installing Phing a million times easier than it already was (and
  most people say that it wasn't too hard in the first place).  Visit
  http://phing.info to either download the latest Phing PEAR-installable 
  package or to learn how to install directly over the network.
  
  If you are reading this document, then you are probably wanting to do
  the custom install, though, so read on ...
  
  Custom Installation
  -------------------

  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Note: for the sake of simple instructions, we will assume you are   |
  | installing PHING to /opt/phing -- of course your installation path  |
  | will probably be different.                                         |
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+  
  
  First download a matching PHING distribution from binarycloud.com/phing and
  untar/gzip it to the desired install directory and optionally create a
  symlink for convinience:

    % cd /opt
    % tar xfz /path/to/phing-x.x.x.tar.gz
    % ln -s phing-x.x.x phing

  The shell script used to launch phing (bin/phing.sh) will attempt to guess 
  most settings if you do not provide them explicitly.  At this point you may 
  want to try running Phing to see how you fare:
  
    % /opt/phing/bin/phing -version
	
  If that worked, then no further setup is necessary; however, you probably 
  want to add a symlink /opt/phing/bin/phing to a location on your path:
  
    % ln -s /opt/phing/bin/phing /usr/local/bin/phing

	
  More Detailed Install Instruction  
  ---------------------------------
  
  If Phing did not run out-of-the-box, then you will probably need to set some 
  environment variables so that Phing knows where to find the PHP executable,
  necessary classes, etc.
  
  Now you have to set the PHP_COMMAND environment variable that points to
  the cli binary of php. For instance, Redhat Linux uses /usr/bin/php, and a
  compile from source installs by default in /usr/local/bin/php. We assume
  /usr/bin/php here. Execute the following command on the shell:

    % export PHP_COMMAND=/usr/bin/php

  Set the PHING_HOME to point to the installation directory of phing. If you
  are installing phing system wide, this is usually /opt/phing.

    % export PHING_HOME=/opt/phing

  Set the PHP_CLASSPATH variable to include $PHING_HOME/classes (optional)

    % export PHP_CLASSPATH="$PHING_HOME/classes"

  You can make additional classpath entries if there's a need for them. I.e.
  adding $BCHOME if you want to access binarycloud packages.

  Now you can add the phing executable to your PATH environment or add a
  symlink to it somewere in your path. We suggest adding a symlink in the
  bin/ dir and also add it to the path:

    % cd $PHING_HOME/bin
    % ln -s phing.sh phing
    % chmod +x phing
    % export PATH=$PATH:$PHING_HOME/bin

  You should now be able to execute Phing from everywhere in your system.
  Try it by changing back to your home and type:

    % phing -version

  Congratulations, you successfully installed Phing.


  Tips & Tricks
  -------------

  If you're using phing frequently consider adding the environment variables
  to you .bash_profile, .bashrc, etc.

  Another commonly used practice for advanced users is to create a build.sh
  file that sets all required variables and executes phing for your project.
  If you do so, you can savely override the bin/phing.sh file and use
  bin/phing.php directly  without checking for environment. If you do so,
  there is basically only one varibale you have to set in your environment:
  PHING_HOME. See bin/phing.sh for details working with the phing.php script.
