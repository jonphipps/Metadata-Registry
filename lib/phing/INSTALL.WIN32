  Welcome to Phing!
  -----------------

  This is only a quick installation guide. For a more details procedure
  see the usersguide pdf in docs/pdf.

  Prerequisites
  -------------

  At this point we assume you have a running Windows NT/2000/XP system 
  running and you properly installed PHP5.0.1+. Windows 9x versions will
  probably work, but are not supported. Make sure that XSL is enabled (e.g.
  enable php_xsl.dll in your php.ini file) if you want to perform builds 
  that require XSLT transformation (e.g. many Binarycloud buildfiles, the 
  Phing "phing_guide" documentation buildfile).

  PEAR Installation
  -----------------

  NOTE: As of Phing 2.0.0b1, Phing is available as a PEAR package.  This 
  makes installing Phing a million times easier than it already was (and
  most people say that it wasn't too hard in the first place).  Visit
  http://phing.info to either download the latest Phing PEAR-installable 
  package or to learn how to install directly over the network.
  
  If you are reading this document, then you are probably wanting to do
  the custom install, though, so read on ...
  
  Custom Installation
  -------------------
    
  First download a matching PHING distribution from http://phing.info and 
  unzip it to the desired install directory.
  
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Note: On Windows 95 and Windows 98, the script used to launch       |
  | Phing will have problems if PHING_HOME is a long filename. This is  |
  | due to limitations in the OS's handling of the "for" batch-file     |
  | statement. It is recommended, therefore, that Phing be installed in |
  | a short path, such as C:\opt\phing.                                 |
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+

  The batch script used to launch phing (bin\phing.bat) will attempt to 
  guess most settings if you do not provide them explicitly.  At this point 
  you may want to try running Phing to see how you fare:
  
    C:\opt\phing\bin\phing -version
	
  If that worked, then no further setup is necessary; however, you probably 
  want to add C:\opt\phing\bin to your PATH environment variable to make it 
  easier to run Phing from any location.
  
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Note: See http://www.cs.usask.ca/grads/wew036/latex/env.html for    |
  | information on how to set environment variables.                    |
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+  
  
  More Detailed Install Instruction  
  ---------------------------------
  
  If Phing did not run out-of-the-box, then you will probably need to set some 
  environment variables so that Phing knows where to find the PHP executable,
  necessary classes, etc.
  
  * Setting %PHP_COMMAND%
  
  If your PHP executable is *not* on the PATH, then you should set the 
  PHP_COMMAND environment variable to point to the CLI binary of PHP.

  For example, if you use the default install dir of PHP, you have to
  set:
   
    set PHP_COMMAND=C:\php\php.exe

  * Setting %PHING_HOME%
	
  You may also set the path to Phing's home directory.  This is no longer 
  necessary if you have not moved any files around (i.e. if the phing.bat 
  file is in bin/ sub directory).  If you encounter problems running Phing,
  you probably want to set this variable (just to be sure):

    set PHING_HOME=C:\opt\phing

  * Setting %PHP_CLASSPATH%
  
  You may also set a PHP_CLASSPATH variable to add any other locations to
  PHP's include_path (Of course, you may also simply add other locations
  directly to the include_path variable in php.ini):

    set PHP_CLASSPATH=%PHING_HOME%\classes

  You can make additional classpath entries if there's a need for them. I.e.
  adding %BCHOME% if you want to access binarycloud packages.

  * Setting %PATH%
  
  Now you can add the phing executable to your PATH environment:

    set PATH=%PATH%;%PHING_HOME%\bin
	
  You're Done!
  ------------
  
  You should now be able to execute Phing from everywhere in your system.
  Try it by changing back to your home and type:

    > phing -version

  Congratulations, you successfully installed Phing.
